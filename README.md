# Time-Series-Analysis
Commodity goods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and
 other essential agricultural products are the backbone of any
 economy. Their prices directly affect not just the cost of living
 for consumers, but also the income and stability of farmers,
 traders, and businesses across the supply chain.In this project,
 we delve into the time series analysis of commodity prices,
 focusing specifically on the price trends of bananas.Through
 this project, we aim to decompose and analyze the historical
 price data of bananas to find the hidden patterns and use
 appropriate forecasting models to estimate future prices. By
 doing so, we demonstrate how time series analysis can offer
 meaningful insights into real-world economic and social sys
tems, especially those that revolve around essential commodity
 goods.
